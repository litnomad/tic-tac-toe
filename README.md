# tic tac toe

The objective of this project is to create a tic tac toe game by putting into practice what I have learned about factory functions and objects, ensuring that objects are used to control the flow of the game and players are stored in objects. The goal is to have as little global code as possible by hiding them inside factories.

Features: 
- User has the option to enter their player name
- Start button to start the game
- Reset button starts the game over

Code:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
