# tic tac toe

The objective of this project is to create a tic tac toe game by putting into practice what I have learned about factory functions and objects, making sure that global codes are minimal by hiding them inside factories. Players are stored in objects and objects are used to control the flow of the game. 

Results:
- The interface for playing has been made to be as simple as possible as the only way to play the game is through the playRound.addToken() method 

Features: 
- User has the option to enter their player name
- Start button to start the game
- Reset button to start the game over

Code:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
